- 📚 Long articles you *don’t have time* to read fully  
- 📝 Important lines you highlight — and then **lose forever**

> This project was built to **fix that problem permanently**.

Not with heavy AI.  
Not with paid APIs.  
But with **pure logic + smart design**.

- Detects important sentences
- Understands repetition & emphasis
- Identifies key signals like:
  - *important*
  - *therefore*

## 🧠 How the Intelligence Works (No Black Box)

|------|-------|
| Sentence appears early | Higher priority |

| Cue words present | Strong signal |
| Repeated keywords | Higher relevance |

Each sentence gets a **score**.  
Top scores win.

Simple. Transparent. Powerful.
